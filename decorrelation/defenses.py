"""Pluggable prompt-level injection defenses over the shared Ollama vote path (TDSC RQ1).

Each defense is a deterministic prompt/probe builder — testable without a model. All are FREE and
prompt-level; `hierarchy`/`struq` are principled surrogates of published defenses (we cannot retrain
local weights), labelled as such per the existing StruQ file. Ingested content is DATA, never instructions.
